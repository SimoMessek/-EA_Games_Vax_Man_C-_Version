# EA_Games_Vax_Man_C++_Version

The second challenge of the Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program is my customized C++ version of the Vax-man game.

Python is an excellent development language. But it has performance limits. When implementing more resource-intensive games, the industry standards are C++ and C#. The choice of language will depend on the platform you use. EA work is done on C++ That is why we have chosen it besides being more of a C++ user considering it's the main language used within Unreal Engine.

To recap, we are building a new game called Vax-Man. The rules are similar to Pac-Man with several notable exceptions:

<ul>
  <li>Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it). </li>
  <li>Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.</li>
  <li>Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).</li>
  <li>The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.</li>
</ul>

<b>Dependencies</b>
<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio Code or your preferred C++ IDE</li>
  <li>Qt Library</li>
</ul>
